&lt;p>A 0.5 (FTE) Postdoctoral Research Fellow Position in Social Psychology is available to develop and evaluate a new set of ‘RESPECT against racism e-resources’ for primary school-aged children. The RESPECT e-modules will generate new knowledge about the best-practice content needed to successfully expand school student’s inclusive thinking and racism reduction in both the short- and long-term. It is anticipated that these stand-alone RESPECT e-resources can be used to support teachers’ delivery of a national anti-racism curriculum that is novel, engaging and educational. This position is funded by an Australian Research Council (ARC) project ‘RESPECT Against Racism: Advancing new anti-racist educational e-modules’ (LP240100299) between The University of Sydney, Western Sydney University, University of Technology Sydney and The Cool Australia Trust.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&lt;strong>One part-time (0.8 FTE) Postdoctoral Research Fellow Position&lt;/strong> available in the School of Psychology, funded by the Australian Research Council (ARC) and led by Professor Fiona White.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A 0.8 (FTE) Postdoctoral Research Fellow Position in Social Psychology is available to develop Mixed-reality (MR) technologies that target the barriers to achieving positive intergroup contact. MR technologies can create highly realistic digital humans, that provide researchers with experimental control, ecological validity, and a unique functionality to change the negative intergroup dynamic via a cooperative exchange, in more natural ways than ever before. It is anticipated that this project will uncover the optimal MR methodologies needed for an immersive, multi-sensorial and dynamic interaction to reduce racism. This position is funded by an Australian Research Council (ARC) project ‘Digital humans as a mixed-reality solution to real-world racism’ (DP250100107) between The University of Sydney and Durham University (UK).&lt;/p>

The post is advertised as ‘open to all areas’ because we currently do not know the exact number of finally approved posts. The outcome of the current planning round will be announced when student numbers are confirmed in autumn. Ideally, we have new academic staff arriving before the start of next academic year. Depending on additional approval of staff requests later this year, we might revisit the shortlist of the current recruitment. The search panel will consist of members from all three research groups.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Assistant Professor in Psychology (Research &amp;amp; Education) (Job Number: 24000984), Open Date 03/06/2024, Closing Date 01/07/2024.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Presentations from shortlisted candidates are scheduled for Tuesday, 13th August. Interviews are scheduled for Wednesday, 14th August.&lt;/p>

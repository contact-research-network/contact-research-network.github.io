As the current chair of the ‘International Contact Research Network’ and on behalf of its executive, I write to make you aware and praise the publishing by Bloomberg’s Katherine Griffiths of a compelling, detailed, evidence-based, cross-validated, multi-source account of endemic and protracted sexual harassment and power exploitation of students and young colleagues by well-known Miles Hewstone and several other male professors at Oxford University.
It is an extensive, shocking, but also long-awaited and unduly overdue report.
Many of us in ICRN went public about our concerns about these matters within our community of scholars, in March 2021 – when we learnt of institutions’ internal reviews and their quiet and concealed ‘separation’ of offenders – in the form of a jointly written Preface of a Special Issue on Advances in Intergroup Contact Research published in the SPSSI flagship Journal of Social Issues (see link to Preface). This document was signed by many colleagues across the globe and levels of seniority.
In the light of the Bloomberg article, there are several things that we feel the need to reiterate.&lt;/p>

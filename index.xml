&lt;p>Our conversations highlighted some priorities and opportunities for future researchðŸ‘‡
ðŸ’¡Contact interventions can promote understanding in schools (Lindsey) and at work (Libby), and reduce political polarisation (MichÃ¨le).
ðŸ’¡Contact in everyday life may also promote understanding, yet we need to further explore how to create successful interactions (Stefania, Deborah &amp;amp; Patrick).
ðŸ’¡There are promising opportunities to use new technologies to promote contact and better intergroup relations - from VR to chatbots (Lukas).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We were particularly excited to also hear from early career researchers who will help shape the future of our research field (Jie, Zackary, Diana, Emine and Ditte).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We struck up various new collaborations and canâ€™t wait to see them play out - and to have further contact researchers join us on the journey ahead.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Welcome social</title><link>https://contact-research-network.github.io/publication/publications_link/</link><pubDate>Thu, 29 Sep 2022 17:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://contact-research-network.github.io/publication/publications_link/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;strong>Join us for a chat and drink after work (after 5pm) on Thursday 29th September to catch up and welcome everyone in the new academic year.&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>

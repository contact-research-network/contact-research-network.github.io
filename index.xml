The conference will be hosted by the International Institute for Peace and Development Studies and limited in size (50 participants or less). In this informal and friendly setting, we seek to bring together psychologists interested in deepening their understanding of peacebuilding processes across multiple levels of analysis: ranging from intra-individual processes focused on achieving inner peace, to intergroup processes that seek to ease tensions between social groups, to global processes that seek to promote peacebuilding. Participants will be encouraged to present research findings and share perspectives that speak to how broad-scale conflicts can be transformed through fostering peace at multiple levels. All participants will be lodged at the Institute.
This event is the latest in the SPSSI-SASP Small Group Conference Series. Along with the Society for Australasian Social Psychology, SPSSI has sponsored small group events addressing: Sustainable Consumption, Intergroup Contact Research, Migration, and Collective Harm-Doing at varied locations on either side of the Pacific: Newcastle, NSW, Denver, CO, Ottawa, CA, Brisbane, QLD, Philadelphia, PA and Melbourne, VIC.
The costs of lodging, food, and transportation to and from the Bangkok airport will be covered by the hosts. Participants will need to arrange and pay for their own (international) transportation to Bangkok airport and a nominal conference fee to secure their place upon confirmation of their acceptance.

&lt;p>Location: Egham, UK
Salary: £39,233 per annum - including London Allowance
Post Type: Full Time
Deadline: 23.59 hours BST on Thursday 22 August 2024&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We are seeking to appoint ambitious research scientists with high-level skills in quantitative research methods and a background in social/political psychology or cognate areas. The posts are available from October 1st 2024, or as soon as possible thereafter. Each appointment is for three years, subject to a review after the first year.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Successful applicants will join the scientific team for the “Secret Power” project. The project, led by Prof. Giovanni Travaglino, was awarded a European Research Council Starting Grant and is funded by UK Research Innovation. It aims to transform the understanding of how individuals and communities from different areas respond to phenomena such as criminal governance, corruption, and the illegal exercise of power and authority. The project uses multiple quantitative methods and approaches, including experimental research, multilevel methodologies focusing on the characteristics of individuals and social/geographical contexts, and longitudinal studies addressing the dynamics of (il)legal socialisation in adolescence. Additional details about the project are available at &lt;a href="https://www.secret-power.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">www.secret-power.org&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Successful applicants will be key to developing the research programme and achieving the project objectives. A central element of the posts will be leading one of the planned longitudinal studies. The objectives of these studies are to investigate the development of attitudes towards various forms of illegality, the acquisition of specific norms and values that may facilitate or impede the exercise of illicit power, and how views of state and non-state power change over time.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The ideal candidate will have a background in social or political psychology (or cognate areas) and expertise in areas such as corruption, collective action, morality, legitimacy, or legal socialisation. High-level quantitative skills and strong knowledge of suitable statistical software (including, but not limited to, R) are a requirement for both posts.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Postholders will be full members of the project&amp;rsquo;s scientific team. They will have the opportunity to get involved in cutting-edge research related to the other aspects of the project (including large multilevel studies and experimental research), engage with colleagues in an interdisciplinary and international environment, and build relationships with external bodies. Postholders will be supported in identifying and developing a plan for personal research objectives linked to the project&amp;rsquo;s main theme and areas.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The posts are based in Egham, Surrey, where the College is situated on a beautiful, leafy campus near Windsor Great Park and within commuting distance of London.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For an informal discussion about the posts, please contact Prof Giovanni Travaglino (&lt;a href="mailto:giovanni.travaglino@rhul.ac.uk">giovanni.travaglino@rhul.ac.uk&lt;/a>).&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Our conversations highlighted some priorities and opportunities for future research👇
💡Contact interventions can promote understanding in schools (Lindsey), at work (Libby) and in conflict situations (Orkun), and reduce political polarisation (Michèle).
💡Contact in everyday life may also promote understanding, yet we need to further explore how to create successful interactions (Stefania, Deborah &amp;amp; Patrick).
💡There are promising opportunities to use new technologies to promote contact and better intergroup relations - from VR to chatbots (Lukas).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We were particularly excited to also hear from early career researchers who will help shape the future of our research field (Jie, Zackary, Diana, Emine and Ditte).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We struck up various new collaborations and can’t wait to see them play out - and to have further contact researchers join us on the journey ahead.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Welcome social</title><link>https://contact-research-network.github.io/publication/publications_link/</link><pubDate>Thu, 29 Sep 2022 17:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://contact-research-network.github.io/publication/publications_link/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;strong>Join us for a chat and drink after work (after 5pm) on Thursday 29th September to catch up and welcome everyone in the new academic year.&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>

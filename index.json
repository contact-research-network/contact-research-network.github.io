I am the author of over 55 peer reviewed journal articles and book chapters and I have delivered 120+ conference papers and book contributions.

My more recent contributions are on topics of intergroup contact seeking and avoidance and contact volition. My research is highly cited by peers and is discussed in policy briefs by peak organisations like the WorldBank, the United Nations, and UK’s Equality and Human Rights Commission.

She received her PhD from Leuphana University of Lüneburg and, after, worked at Oxford Brookes University and Justus Liebig University in Giessen. In addition to her academic career, Ulrike has professional experience in the areas of human resources and management consulting. Next to her research on work and aging, Ulrike studies workplace relationships and diversity management, knowledge transfer and learning, sustainable career development, and organizational behavior, technology and change. Her research is well supported through competitive grants, including the British Academy, the German Research Foundation, the Volkswagen Foundation, and the European Union\u0026rsquo;s COST Action Initiative, and has been published in high-quality journals such as the Journal of Applied Psychology, Personnel Psychology, and Human Relations. In 2021, Ulrike received the Dr. Herbert Stolzenberg Award for her research. With the population aging in many countries across the world, and the associated societal tensions, the topic of work and aging is a very critical one, and her research is making a substantial contribution to this field. Building on her early work on intergenerational contact in hiring decisions, Ulrike has developed a broader research stream on intergroup contact at work. Her studies show how positive intergroup contact—initially between different age groups in hiring contexts, and later extending to age-diverse workplace friendships—can reduce social tensions, foster cooperation, and support employee well-being and organizational harmony. Ulrike currently serves as an Associate Editor of the Journal of Occupational and Organizational Psychology, and is on the Editorial Boards of Personnel Psychology, Work, Aging and Retirement, the Journal of Vocational Behavior, Management Review Quarterly, and the Journal of Organizational Behavior.\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"term","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"e71162a23e63959d6f6a974b96a81838","permalink":"https://contact-research-network.github.io/author/ulrike-fasbender/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/author/ulrike-fasbender/","section":"authors","summary":"Ulrike is a Full Professor and Head of the Business and Organizational Psychology Chair at the Institute for Education, Work and Society – University of Hohenheim in Stuttgart, Germany.

The conference will be hosted by the International Institute for Peace and Development Studies and limited in size (50 participants or less). In this informal and friendly setting, we seek to bring together psychologists interested in deepening their understanding of peacebuilding processes across multiple levels of analysis: ranging from intra-individual processes focused on achieving inner peace, to intergroup processes that seek to ease tensions between social groups, to global processes that seek to promote peacebuilding. Participants will be encouraged to present research findings and share perspectives that speak to how broad-scale conflicts can be transformed through fostering peace at multiple levels. All participants will be lodged at the Institute. This event is the latest in the SPSSI-SASP Small Group Conference Series. Along with the Society for Australasian Social Psychology, SPSSI has sponsored small group events addressing: Sustainable Consumption, Intergroup Contact Research, Migration, and Collective Harm-Doing at varied locations on either side of the Pacific: Newcastle, NSW, Denver, CO, Ottawa, CA, Brisbane, QLD, Philadelphia, PA and Melbourne, VIC.

The posts are available from October 1st 2024, or as soon as possible thereafter. Each appointment is for three years, subject to a review after the first year.\nSuccessful applicants will join the scientific team for the “Secret Power” project. The project, led by Prof. Giovanni Travaglino, was awarded a European Research Council Starting Grant and is funded by UK Research Innovation. It aims to transform the understanding of how individuals and communities from different areas respond to phenomena such as criminal governance, corruption, and the illegal exercise of power and authority. The project uses multiple quantitative methods and approaches, including experimental research, multilevel methodologies focusing on the characteristics of individuals and social/geographical contexts, and longitudinal studies addressing the dynamics of (il)legal socialisation in adolescence. Additional details about the project are available at www.secret-power.org.\nSuccessful applicants will be key to developing the research programme and achieving the project objectives. A central element of the posts will be leading one of the planned longitudinal studies. The objectives of these studies are to investigate the development of attitudes towards various forms of illegality, the acquisition of specific norms and values that may facilitate or impede the exercise of illicit power, and how views of state and non-state power change over time.\nThe ideal candidate will have a background in social or political psychology (or cognate areas) and expertise in areas such as corruption, collective action, morality, legitimacy, or legal socialisation. High-level quantitative skills and strong knowledge of suitable statistical software (including, but not limited to, R) are a requirement for both posts.\nPostholders will be full members of the project\u0026rsquo;s scientific team.

The posts are available from October 1st 2024, or as soon as possible thereafter. Each appointment is for three years, subject to a review after the first year.\nSuccessful applicants will join the scientific team for the “Secret Power” project. The project, led by Prof. Giovanni Travaglino, was awarded a European Research Council Starting Grant and is funded by UK Research Innovation. It aims to transform the understanding of how individuals and communities from different areas respond to phenomena such as criminal governance, corruption, and the illegal exercise of power and authority. The project uses multiple quantitative methods and approaches, including experimental research, multilevel methodologies focusing on the characteristics of individuals and social/geographical contexts, and longitudinal studies addressing the dynamics of (il)legal socialisation in adolescence. Additional details about the project are available at www.secret-power.org.\nSuccessful applicants will be key to developing the research programme and achieving the project objectives. A central element of the posts will be leading one of the planned longitudinal studies. The objectives of these studies are to investigate the development of attitudes towards various forms of illegality, the acquisition of specific norms and values that may facilitate or impede the exercise of illicit power, and how views of state and non-state power change over time.\nThe ideal candidate will have a background in social or political psychology (or cognate areas) and expertise in areas such as corruption, collective action, morality, legitimacy, or legal socialisation. High-level quantitative skills and strong knowledge of suitable statistical software (including, but not limited to, R) are a requirement for both posts.\nPostholders will be full members of the project\u0026rsquo;s scientific team. They will have the opportunity to get involved in cutting-edge research related to the other aspects of the project (including large multilevel studies and experimental research), engage with colleagues in an interdisciplinary and international environment, and build relationships with external bodies. Postholders will be supported in identifying and developing a plan for personal research objectives linked to the project\u0026rsquo;s main theme and areas.\nThe posts are based in Egham, Surrey, where the College is situated on a beautiful, leafy campus near Windsor Great Park and within commuting distance of London.\nFor an informal discussion about the posts, please contact Prof Giovanni Travaglino (giovanni.travaglino@rhul.ac.uk).\nRead more\n","date":1721865600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1721865600,"objectID":"31e3615e50f75c094fc1894ba74ab649","permalink":"https://contact-research-network.github.io/post/2024-7-postdoctoral-research-associates-in-socialpolitical-psychology-2-positions-available/","publishdate":"2024-07-25T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/2024-7-postdoctoral-research-associates-in-socialpolitical-psychology-2-positions-available/","section":"post","summary":"Applications are invited for two posts of Postdoctoral Research Associate at the Institute for the Study of Power, Crime, and Society, Royal Holloway, University of London.\nLocation: Egham, UK Salary: £39,233 per annum - including London Allowance Post Type: Full Time Deadline: 23.59 hours BST on Thursday 22 August 2024","tags":[],"title":"Postdoctoral Research Associates in Social/Political Psychology (2 Positions available)","type":"post"},{"authors":["Michèle Birtel"],"categories":["jobs"],"content":"Applicants are invited to apply for a full time post doctoral position commencing October 1st 2024 at the Department of Social Psychology at the Friedrich-Schiller-University, Jena, Germany.

In that role, you would work with Rose Meleady, Shelley McKeown-Jones, George Leckie and Belong, the Social Cohesion and Integration Charity. The project aims to identify structural and psychological antecedents of intergroup contact&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Our conversations highlighted some priorities and opportunities for future researchðŸ‘‡&lt;br>
ðŸ’¡Contact interventions can promote understanding in schools (Lindsey) and at work (Libby), and reduce political polarisation (MichÃ¨le).&lt;br>
ðŸ’¡Contact in everyday life may also promote understanding, yet we need to further explore how to create successful interactions (Stefania, Deborah &amp;amp; Patrick).&lt;br>
ðŸ’¡There are promising opportunities to use new technologies to promote contact and better intergroup relations - from VR to chatbots (Lukas).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We were particularly excited to also hear from early career researchers who will help shape the future of our research field (Jie, Zackary, Diana, Emine and Ditte).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We struck up various new collaborations and can&amp;rsquo;t wait to see them play out - and to have further contact researchers join us on the journey ahead.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>First Network Summit Concluded</title><link>https://contact-research-network.github.io/post/2024-5-first-network-summit-concluded/</link><pubDate>Fri, 31 May 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://contact-research-network.github.io/post/2024-5-first-network-summit-concluded/</guid><description>&lt;p>ðŸŒŸ We just completed the inaugural summit of the new international Contact Research Network - thanks to the amazing colleagues who spent the last 2 days with us in London at Birkbeck!ðŸŒŸ&lt;/p>

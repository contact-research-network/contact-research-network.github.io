Depending on additional approval of staff requests later this year, we might revisit the shortlist of the current recruitment.

&lt;p>Our conversations highlighted some priorities and opportunities for future researchðŸ‘‡
ðŸ’¡Contact interventions can promote understanding in schools (Lindsey) and at work (Libby), and reduce political polarisation (MichÃ¨le).
ðŸ’¡Contact in everyday life may also promote understanding, yet we need to further explore how to create successful interactions (Stefania, Deborah &amp;amp; Patrick).
ðŸ’¡There are promising opportunities to use new technologies to promote contact and better intergroup relations - from VR to chatbots (Lukas).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We were particularly excited to also hear from early career researchers who will help shape the future of our research field (Jie, Zackary, Diana, Emine and Ditte).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We struck up various new collaborations and canâ€™t wait to see them play out - and to have further contact researchers join us on the journey ahead.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>

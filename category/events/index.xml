This includes a new section dedicated to the wishes and needs of our early postgraduate researcher community!
While we are busy getting a few last details organised before we release the full list of speakers and schedule, we would like to announce that &lt;em>Prof. Jake Harwood, University of Arizona&lt;/em> will kick us off on &lt;strong>Friday, 31st October 2025, 3-4 pm British time.&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>The rhythm is gonna get you: What people do during contact matters&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>Jake Harwood, Department of Communication, University of Arizona&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This talk will discuss the importance of considering “what happens” during intergroup contact. It argues that specific activities that parties engage in during contact have implications for the mechanisms likely to mediate contact’s effects. Experimental studies of indirect contact’s effects will be discussed, including studies focusing on musical activity as a particularly potent platform for intergroup contact. The talk concludes with thoughts on the diversity and complexity of “positive intergroup contact.”&lt;/p>

The conference will be hosted by the International Institute for Peace and Development Studies and limited in size (50 participants or less). In this informal and friendly setting, we seek to bring together psychologists interested in deepening their understanding of peacebuilding processes across multiple levels of analysis: ranging from intra-individual processes focused on achieving inner peace, to intergroup processes that seek to ease tensions between social groups, to global processes that seek to promote peacebuilding. Participants will be encouraged to present research findings and share perspectives that speak to how broad-scale conflicts can be transformed through fostering peace at multiple levels. All participants will be lodged at the Institute.
This event is the latest in the SPSSI-SASP Small Group Conference Series. Along with the Society for Australasian Social Psychology, SPSSI has sponsored small group events addressing: Sustainable Consumption, Intergroup Contact Research, Migration, and Collective Harm-Doing at varied locations on either side of the Pacific: Newcastle, NSW, Denver, CO, Ottawa, CA, Brisbane, QLD, Philadelphia, PA and Melbourne, VIC.
The costs of lodging, food, and transportation to and from the Bangkok airport will be covered by the hosts. Participants will need to arrange and pay for their own (international) transportation to Bangkok airport and a nominal conference fee to secure their place upon confirmation of their acceptance.
Attached please find a flyer for the event. You can express an interest in attending by completing the following form: &lt;a href="https://forms.gle/WGNQXXPY5UACfWF7A" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://forms.gle/WGNQXXPY5UACfWF7A&lt;/a>
Please submit your Expression of Interest (EOI) by midnight February 14th, in your local time zone. We will endeavor to confirm acceptance in March, with an expectation that attendees will confirm their registration and pay the nominal fee in April.

&lt;p>Our conversations highlighted some priorities and opportunities for future research👇
💡Contact interventions can promote understanding in schools (Lindsey), at work (Libby) and in conflict situations (Orkun), and reduce political polarisation (Michèle).
💡Contact in everyday life may also promote understanding, yet we need to further explore how to create successful interactions (Stefania, Deborah &amp;amp; Patrick).
💡There are promising opportunities to use new technologies to promote contact and better intergroup relations - from VR to chatbots (Lukas).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We were particularly excited to also hear from early career researchers who will help shape the future of our research field (Jie, Zackary, Diana, Emine and Ditte).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We struck up various new collaborations and can’t wait to see them play out - and to have further contact researchers join us on the journey ahead.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
